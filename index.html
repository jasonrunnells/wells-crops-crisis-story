            This project analyzes groundwater level changes in Tulare County, California from 2004 to 2024 using well data, spatial statistics, and landcover data. It identifies both spatial and behavioral clusters of groundwater decline and examines the types of landcover found near wells that experienced the most severe declines during the study period to explore potential relationships between landcover/agriculture and groundwater stress. While not intended to establish causation, the analysis is intended to highlight spatial patterns that may support future research and inform more sustainable water and land management strategies.

        <p class="width-75 reveal2">
            Tulare County sits in California's Central Valley—one of the most productive agricultural regions in the entire country and one of the most groundwater-dependent. With limited surface water availability and a large portion of land dedicated to farming, groundwater plays a critical role in supporting both agriculture and the county's rural communities. Because of these factors, Tulare County is a prime location for examining the long-term impacts of groundwater use and management in the state.

                    During dry years, approximately 95% of Tulare County's water supply comes from wells (Department of Water Resources). As surfacewater sources have become less reliable due to drought and reduced allocations, dependence on groundwater has grown. In response, many wells have been drilled deeper to access more water—providing short-term relief but placing additional strain on already depleted aquifers.

                    Tulare County is one of California's top farming regions, producing a wide range of crops such as almonds, grapes, citrus, and alfalfa.

                    As surface water declined, groundwater pumping surged—leading to dry wells, land subsidence, and long-term water access issues. In response, the 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) mandated local agencies restore balance. Tulare County now sits at the heart of this transition, where agriculture must reckon with the limits of a once-reliable resource.

            Water Surface Elevation (WSE) measures the depth from the ground surface to the water level in a well and is a key indicator of groundwater availability. To track long-term changes, WSE data from 110 wells were analyzed over a 20-year period, from 2004 to 2024. In an effort to standardize the WSE measurements and to minimize seasonal variation, only measurements taken during the month of October were used for each year to represent late-season, low-recharge groundwater conditions.

                        Hot Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) was used to identify statistically significant clusters of groundwater decline across Tulare County. By analyzing the overall change in WSE from 2004-2024, areas with unusually high or low changes were detected based on spatial relationships between wells.
                    </p>
                    <p class="reveal2">
                        The results highlight hot spots—clusters of wells with significantly greater decline than expected—and cold spots, where decline was minimal or where conditions were relatively stable in relation to neighboring wells. This method helps visualize where groundwater loss is most concentrated and provides insight into spatial patterns that may reflect land use, pumping intensity, or other contributing factors.

            Out of the 110 wells analyzed, 30 were identified as statistically significant hot spots with 99% confidence and were located in the southwestern part of the county. These wells represent only one piece of the overall picture, but they're important because they pinpoint where the most severe groundwater declines were geographically concentrated.

        <div class="section-separator reveal"></div>
        <p class="width-75 reveal2">
            While hot spot analysis reveals where groundwater decline is concentrated, it does not capture how individual wells are changing over time. To address that, a multivariate clustering analysis was performed using WSE change and slope. This approach allowed for grouping of the 110 wells into three distinct categories based on their long-term WSE trends: Severe Decline, Moderate Decline, and Stable. Unlike the spatial findings from the hot spot analysis, multivariate clustering highlights individual well behavior regardless of location, offering a clearer picture of which wells are experiencing the most persistent and extreme groundwater loss over time.

                        The trendline indicates a strong positive correlation (R² ≈ 0.79), suggesting that wells with greater overall declines also tended to have steeper annual rates of decline. This high R² value reinforces the importance of using both metrics in tandem for the clustering analysis, as it reflects a consistent relationship between the overall magnitude and the pace of groundwater loss.

            Now that the geographic locations containing the greatest groundwater declines in Tulare County have been identified—along with the 13 most severely impacted wells in the study group—we can begin examining land use patterns around those specific wells. The next step is to analyze landcover data within the 500-meter buffers applied in the previous step to explore whether certain landcover types are more commonly associated with severely declining wells, and to identify any patterns that may suggest a relationship between landcover and groundwater decline.

                    The USDA's Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a nationwide raster dataset that classifies landcover based on satellite imagery and agricultural surveys. Each pixel represents a specific crop or landcover type, allowing for highly detailed analysis. While the overall study period spans from 2004 to 2024, CDL data for Tulare County is only available beginning in 2007. As a result, all landcover-related analysis in this project reflects the period from 2007 to 2024, the earliest range for which consistent landcover data is available.

Despite appearing in fewer wells, Almonds and Winter Wheat made up a larger proportion of the total landcover near the well samples.

        <h2 id="conclusion" class="reveal">Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="section-separator reveal"></div>
        <p class="width-75 reveal2">
            This project set out to understand the scope, distribution, and potential drivers of groundwater decline in Tulare County from 2004 to 2024. Through spatial and temporal analysis of 110 wells, we identified that the most severe groundwater declines were not only geographically concentrated in the southwestern region but also behaviorally distinct—characterized by steep, long-term declines in water surface elevation. By combining Hot Spot Analysis, Multivariate Clustering, and investigating landcover characteristics, we now have a multi-dimensional view of how and where groundwater loss is occurring.
        </p>
        <p class="width-75 reveal2">
            While causation cannot be and was not intended to be definitively established, the findings suggest meaningful associations between certain landcover patterns and severe groundwater decline. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fallow/Idle Cropland</span> was most prominent around wells with the greatest decline, potentially signaling responses to water scarcity. In addition, higher proportions of crops like <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alfalfa</span> were found in more stable areas, while water-intensive crops such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Winter</span> Wheat were more dominant in declining regions. 
        </p>
        <p class="width-75 reveal2">
            These patterns highlight the importance of long-term groundwater tracking and how land use and water availability are connected—especially as the region currently works to meet the goals of California's SGMA. In Tulare County, where many areas continue to remain critically overdrafted (as of 2024), this type of localized analysis is important and can be used to help guide future groundwater decision making.
